The name is Nickolas Fuentes but I go by Nick. I just moved back to my hometown of Houston, Texas after obtaining a degree in Public Relations and Mass Communications. I would love to stay in the city of Houston but if I ever got a job opportunity to move up north, where seasons actually exist, it will be a hard decision.

I love playing basketball on my free time and have been playing for about five years now. Basketball is a very big part of my life, it is a way I stay active and relieve any stress. I am huge sports fan of the Astros, Texans, Rockets and Dynamo if they are on T.V. I will watch and cheer till I loose my voice. I am a believer in God and call myself a Christian and am blessed that he has guided me this far and given me the support that I have surrounding me. I have never been much of an adventurous person but spending my years in college where my surroundings were hiking trails, nature and lakes it became another hobby for me. I hope as the years go by I visit more national parks and hiking trails to see and explore.

One of the biggest lessons in life that I am focusing on is not spending money on things but on memories. I was the type of person who loved getting the latest and greatest technology, clothes and whatever else I could think of but being in college I experienced so many great memories that are priceless. I hope as time goes by I can implement this thinking more into my life.

Well that is pretty much me hope I was not to all over the place.  I know by now your wondering but wait Nick why have you not said anything about how you got started writing code yet? Well that is a topic for the next blog. Thank you to all who took the time to read this article.
