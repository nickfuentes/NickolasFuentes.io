excerpt: "This is the reason why I want to blog."

So lets dive into why I am starting this blog. I have never been a blogger and would not consider myself a person that would. But as I started to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript I was became over whelmed with the amount of resources there was out there. There were times when I learned something but then looked it up and someone did it another way. How do people know what is the correct way to write a line of code?

There were times when I had to step away with frustration of wanting to find the right way to do something. But when I was stepping away from my text editor I would look for motivation from other programmers on sources like Instagram, YouTube and Blogs. They all gave same advice to new programmers like myself to not give up and to keep learning. They would say the beginning is the hardest part and after that you will get the hang of it. So I took this advice and pushed through source after source until I finally got the basics of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap the way I wanted it to work and look and the correct way. I learned how to put certain things in a div, how to style an HTML file with CSS and use the class container properly. It was just trial and error and actually inputting it into a text editor and playing around with it. I by no means am a pro at HTML, CSS and Bootstrap but I am not scared of it because I know it is a matter of time that I will understand it correctly.

All those trial and errors made me realize there are many other beginner programmers out there going through the same thing. Most of us only see the other side of making it and becoming a programmer and seeing the success part. I hope I can capture the side of programming that is tough. I want to be able to show others a point of view from the beginning to hopefully the end of what it takes to learn a programming language.
