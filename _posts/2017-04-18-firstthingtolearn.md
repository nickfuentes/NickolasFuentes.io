So you are beginner and interested in learning web development. The first thing you are going to need to learn is HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). HTML is the foundation of becoming a web developer and is what you see when viewing a website. HTML can be the paragraphs, the photos, buttons, navigation bar, etc. I would get a strong understanding of this.

The next thing I would learn is CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). You can think of CSS as make-up for HTML, which makes it look even more beautiful. CSS can make regular paragraphs more enjoyable to read with Google Fonts. You can add a color theme to your website down to the shade of your choosing with using RGB and HEX colors. If you want to center or move an image to the left or right that is also done in CSS. CSS is a big design aspect it and can make your website a totally new site if done right.

The sources I would recommend for this is HTML and CSS by John Duckett, CodeCademy and FreeCodeCamp. Hope you all have a fun time learning HTML and CSS till next time!
