First thing you do of course is create a website from scratch using HTML, CSS and any other language or framework you know. The reasoning behind creating it first is so you are not paying for a site with nothing on it. After having all the code completed you should look for a hosting domain that would host my site. You might have to go through 10 hosting sites like HostGator, GoDaddy, BlueHost and ect. It is up to you to choose a price, speed, and customer service each one offer. You will purchase the site and get a domain name and account and you are all set up on that part.

Then you will need a way to upload your files to the server and to do that you will need a FTP which is a (File Transfer Protocol). You have a choice between FileZilia, Cyberduck, Fetch and ect. Again it is up to you choose which one you like to use, most of them are the same with a few different options like drag and drop. But listen closely there will be an option to transfer your files as a SFTP, which is a SSH File transfer protocol. It is much safer to do this when uploading your files so please read up on SFTP it is more protective. In order to set that up all you need to do on your hosting site once logged in is to change the settings to SSH on, depending on your hosting site it will be different to do so.
 
Then when you go to upload files on your FTP choose SFTP option and type in your domain, username and password and it will take you to your files on your domain, only enter your files into the public folder or web folder. Make sure to not delete any other folders or move them. Trust me I learned the hard way and had to call customer service. Just update the public folder or web folder with your HTML and CSS files. You should be able to refresh your browser and see the changes on your site.
