	Having a responsive website is very important in 2017. After researching some valid points from multiple sites. Here are a couple of reasons you should update your site or start developing mobile friendly websites.

	Google has changed their algorithm in April 2015 to display mobile friendly sites in the searched results. I cannot speak for everyone but I do not know anyone who does not use Google as a search engine. Most likely your customer or client is going be searching for your site on Google and if it is not mobile friendly it could be penalized.

	A website looks better when it is responsive. When customers or clients land on your website they do not want to pinch or squint to read the text. Clicking on links on the mobile version can be very difficult and lead to frustration. Users have been recorded of leaving the site if navigation is difficult.

	Your business can take a hit. If your business has been attracting new customers they will likely want to know what you have to offer, whether that be a product or service. They will most likely search for you online and see a menu or product list. Everyone knows how important a first impression is and your site can be that first impression.

	Keeping your current customers. The hard part is not getting new customers but keeping them. If you have customers that love the service or product you provide you want to keep them coming back and make your product or service easily accessible. With a non-mobile friendly website it could make it difficult for the customers to keep making purchases on your site or view your services.

 	How to go about making your site mobile friendly? For clients if your site is not responsive you can ask your web developer or find a web developer to make your site ready for smart phones and tablets. For web developers there is two ways I go about making a site mobile friendly. One is to use media queries in the CSS to adjust to certain screen sizes. Chrome Developer tools also aid in the help of making sure you developing in the right screen width. I have also used Bootstrap, a front-end framework, to make sites mobile friendly. Bootstrap has a grid system, which is responsive by default and makes it super easy to create a website for all devices.
