This will be a series of Rails articles that will explain the information I am introduced to along the way. The first one being the “Intro To Ruby On Rails” and other articles that will follow, as I will try to focus on the important topics of Rails. Article topics will include convention over configuration, models, views, controllers (MVC), create, read, update, delete (CRUD) and so much more. This article series will not just be for people who are interested in Rails but anyone curious on what other languages offer.

Lets begin with some prerequisites before diving into Rails, which is Ruby. Ruby is a backend language created by Yukihiro Matsumoto or known as Matz in 1995. Ruby was based on some of Matz favorite programming languages such as Perl and Lisp. Matz main focus was making Ruby enjoyable and focused on trying to make it natural not simple.

I would recommend spending some adequate amount of time learning the basics of Ruby. You don’t have to be an expert in Ruby to dive into Rails but understanding the basic concepts of modules, classes and objects will help tremendously. If you have spent some time learning JavaScript you will enjoy the syntax changes in Ruby. I myself jumped into Rails a little to fast and struggled to understand these simple concepts. So I had to jump back into Ruby after struggling in Rails for a while and start the process all over again. So that is why I recommend learning some Ruby first before jumping into Rails.

Now lets dive into Rails the most popular Ruby framework. David Heinemeier Hansson created Ruby on Rails or Rails for short in 2003. While Hansson was working on the code base for Basecamp, he merged Rails and officially released Rails as an open source code in July of 2004.

Rails software pattern (MVC) Models, Views, Controllers, which I enjoy is the way the code is maintained. I will write an article specifically down the road that is more depth on this topic. Rails also goes by the saying “Convention over Configuration” also known as coding convention.

As I obtain more knowledge of Rails I will document my research and relate back to you in these articles. I hope you enjoyed just a taste of Rails has to offer. Look out for the next articles coming next week.
